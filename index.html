        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Software Design Patterns (using Ruby)</b>: I think being aware of Design Patterns is imperative in becoming a great software engineer. 
            I am actively learning Ruby at the same time, by incorporating RSpec testing framework. Two birds in one shot.

        <h2>Habit Stacking</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Meditation</b>: I am not planning to sit for 15 minutes, or 10 minutes, or even 5 minutes. I am planning to start with
            absolute minimal commitment. I will start with meditating for just 2 minutes, and then I will add up from there once sitting for 
            2 minutes becomes a habit. This is the spirit of Kaizen.

            Have had a significant break since I last ran in August. Navy Marathon is coming up in November. I need to start.
